ROS System Tutorial  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by Ryan Zavoral

Start Sub
---------

start ros main - 

    roscore &
start simulator - 

    rosrun subsim sim
start software stack -

    roslaunch subsim run.launch

Start Virtual Boat
------------------

start rosmain -

    roscore &
start boatsim and software stack - 

    roslaunch boatsim run.launch

Boat Startup (for 3d mouse)
---------------------------

(for actual boat...make sure you are ssh'd in. Only one person should do this at a time)
    
    roscore &
    roslaunch propagator_motor_driver start_motor_driver.launch //starts only motors
    rosrun thruster_mapper thruster_mapper //displays thruster values
    rosrun thruster_mapper joy_to_wrench joy:=spacenav/joy //3d mouse mapped to thrusters

Waypoints Boat 
--------------

Gps takes a bit to synch so leave running

    roslaunch boat_launch navigation.launch  
Runs software stack and motors (basically everything, runs some stuff from line 42)

    roslaunch boat_launch run.launch 
From file - /sub_launch/scripts/send_waypoint (this is an executable)  
'send_waypoint forward 5 --speed .2'  
'send_waypoint set_orientation NORTH'  
'send_waypoint yaw_left_deg 30'  

Waypoint Aliases
----------------

send waypoints - 

    alias wp="rosrun sub_launch send_waypoint"
    alias k="rosrun kill_handling kill"
    wp (forward, raise, depth, left, right) magnitude

Making Missions
---------------

-Preliminary Setup

    roscd && cd ../src && mkdir uf-mil && cd uf-mil && for A in rawgps-tools software-common hardware-common SubjuGator PropaGator ; do git clone https://github.com/uf-mil/$A.git ; done && git clone https://github.com/txros/txros.git
Go in each directory within `~/catkin_ws/src/uf-mil` and type `git pull`. After that, recompile by running `catkin_make -C ~/catkin_ws`.

    sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
    catkin_make -C ~/catkin_ws
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/uf-mil/Subjugator/sub_launch/src/sub_launch/missions
    roscore && rosrun mission_core run_missions sub_launch.missions.square
This is a simple python script. Use it as a template to create your own script for the sub to run. For more sub commands, navigate to folder to see files:

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/uf-mil/software_common/uf_common/src/uf_common/orientation_helpers.py
After creating your own, 
    
    catkin_make -C ~/catkin_ws 
    rosrun mission_core run_mission sub_launch.mission.<your mission>
There is also a path.py mission. To run do the following:  
Kill the sub by pressing 1.   
Start the down cameras with:  

    rosrun sub_launch camera_views down
    rosrun sub_launch legacy_debug_images down.
Use i-j-k-l keys to position the sub over the pipe.   
Press 2 to reactivate sub.  
    rosrun mission_core run_missions sub_launch.missions.path 

Redo the the path.py script with the "reef" object (a box with a blinking pinger under it). Try with different camera views.

Motor
----- 

manual edit calibration: pd_controller.py

Camera
------

Run camera

    rosrun ueye2 ueye2
Show forward camera -

    rosrun image_view image_view image:=(output device)
CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING AT THIS POINT (More output devices exist so we need to find their names so that they may be accessed)  
output device1 = forward_camera/image_rect_color  
output device2 = image_raw/  

record video rosbag from front - 

    rosbag record -O #NAME_OF_VIDEO# /forward_camera/(output device)
record video rosbag from boat - 

    rosbag record -O #NAME_OF_VIDEO# /(output device)
play rosbag video - 

    rosbag play #NAME_OF_VIDEO#.bag

Magnetic Calibration
--------------------

<ul>
<li>Kill the submarine (by pressing 1)</li>
<li>Start recording raw magnetic data (rosbag record /imu/mag_raw)</li>
<li>Rotate the submarine, sampling every possible rotation (look at subsim's README.md)</li>
<li>Stop recording (press Ctrl-c on rosbag)</li>
<li>Generate the calibration result (rosrun magnetic_hardsoft_compensation generate_config NAME_OF_THE_BAG_FILE_YOU_PRODUCED). Make sure that the points cover the entire sphere. If they don't, re-record the data. Close the window.</li>
<li>Paste the generated configuration (the last 5 lines of output after closing the window) into sub_launch/launch/common.xml, replacing the similar 5 lines that are already there.</li>
<li>Stop and restart the main "roslaunch subsim run.launch" process to load the new configuration.</li>
</ul>
Display info tests
------------------

    rostopic echo /gps
    rostopic echo /odom
    rostopic echo /trajectory

Getting Used to System
----------------------

NAVIGATE THROUGH IT - check what is executable, compare it with some of the commands in this file, try some stuff out that you think is convuluted or obtuse  
`rqt_graph` shows graph allows user to become acquainted with the system  

Git
---

##### How to Use Git #####
`git clone repositoryurl` CLONES a repository into your file directory at the current location 

    git clone https://github.com/rzavo76/getting-started.git

`git init nameofdirOrRepositoryUrl` MAKES a repository linked to the directory or URL  
<ul>
<li>I recommend using the URL to link instead of the directory when making a new repository</li>
<li>So the repository should be initialized via the github site before hand</li>
</ul>
`git pull` PULLS updates to the cloned or initiated repository at your current location

##### After Forking Repository to Git #####
    
    git add fileName 
    git commit -m"message"
    git push URLOfGitFork 

Pushes a specific file to your repository, add more files if necessary  
Then send a commit request via your github site at the forked repository  
Someone should allow the request soon after.  

##### If Command Below Doesn't Work #####

    git stash
    git pull /home/fvoight/catkin_ws/src/uf-mil/PropaGator












Make Models for Simulator
-------------------------

Can choose object or edit mode based on the bottom tab
#### Controls ####
hold middle mouse button - turn camera
scroll middle mouse button - zoom in/out
'b' then click and drag - select specific edges or vertices
'a' - select all and unselect all
'g' - grab
	'x' - to move in x coords only
	'y' - to move in y coords only
	'z' - to move in z coords only
'r' - rotate (x, y, z)
'x' - delete selected object

#### Panels ####
'n' - opens transform panel to move the selected object based on coord  
in edit mode use subdivide on the left panel to allow more locations of movement on a line  
common to delete different vertices to leave a line and then create a vertical plane afterwards using subdivice on points  

#### Making Model ####
<ol>
<li>Delete default block</li>
<li>Consider a spatial method to easily deconstruct the object you are creating (ex. make a single plane and rotate or add default shapes)</li>
<li>Add an object that you can easily deconstruct</li>
<li>Set imperial units under scene on the right panel (this changes the grid)</li>
<li>Deconstruct the shape or add more objects</li>
<li>Move vertices to specific locations of merit(subdivide to get more points)</li>
<li>Rotate or ascribe more dimension to the object</li>
<li>Render image to see how the object will look</li>
<li>Save as a blend file</li>
<li>Export as an obj file - click triangulate faces - change forward to y forward</li>
</ol>

#### Uploading To World ####
Upload by finding the file through

    roscd boatsim
    cd scripts
    nano sim 
Type this code and change every iteration of FILE_NAME OR NAME to your decided name or file name.

    NAME_mesh = threed.mesh_from_obj(roslib.packages.resource_file('boatsim', 'models', 'FILE_NAME.obj')) // gives access to the file
    NAME_mesh = NAME_mesh.translate((x,y,z)) //moves the object
    w.objs.append(NAME_mesh) //adds to world
    NAME_geom = ode.GeomTriMesh(NAME_mesh.ode_trimeshdata, space) // this line makes it so the object is solid
