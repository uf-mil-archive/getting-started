first start up the sub simulator with

    rosrun subsim sim

to start everything related to the simulator run

    roslaunch subsim run.launch


Premade missions are located in the directory

    catkin_ws/src/uf-mil/SubjuGator/sub_launch/src/sub_launch/missions

so for example you can run square path missions with the command

    rosrun mission_core run_missions sub_launch.missions.square

A mission can have an objective based on a goal like centering on a pipe with the code:

    yield sub.visual_align('down', 'pipe')

All of the possible objectives (like visual_align and move) come from the import of sub_scripting. If you would like to see the actual code related to this look at the file: __init__.py
